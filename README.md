# Himachal Pradesh Tourism Website

My first web application! A simple website that gives travel recommendations for Himachal Pradesh using AI.

## What it does

- You enter when you want to visit (season, month, etc.)
- It gives you 3 AI-powered place recommendations
- Looks pretty with animated backgrounds of Himachal

## Tech I used

- **Python & Flask** - Backend
- **Google Gemini AI** - For recommendations  
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - Frontend
- **Lots of AI help** - ChatGPT/Claude/DeepSeek helped me learn and debug

## How to run it

1. Clone this repo
2. Install stuff: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Make a `.env` file with:
   ```
   API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key
   SECRET_KEY=any_random_string
   ```
4. Run: `python app.py`
5. Go to `http://localhost:5000`

## Get Google AI API key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Make an API key
3. Put it in your `.env` file

## What I learned

This was my first real project. I learned:
- How to make a web app with Flask
- Using AI APIs
- Making things look good with CSS
- Git and GitHub

I used AI a lot to help me understand concepts, fix bugs, and improve my code. The idea was mine, but AI was like having a coding mentor.

## Screenshots

*Will add screenshots soon*

## Future plans

- Add a map
- More detailed recommendations
- Maybe weather info
